## Abstract
Music-driven motion generation has seen growing interest, while conducting remains less explored. We study this task in the context of choral repertoire. Our method uses a phase-based beat cue that locates each frame within the current beat and a diffusion model conditioned on musical features to promote timing consistency and natural upper-body motion. Evaluations on held-out pieces indicate clearer beat alignment and plausible gestures compared with representative baselines.
